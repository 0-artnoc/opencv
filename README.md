Matlab Generator
----------------
This project is a fork of OpenCV (https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/) with a matlab module for automagically generating Matlab bindings. Once complete, this branch will be merged into the OpenCV 3.x master.

This project is currently, and always will be, in a semi-working state. When the project is stable it will be merged, and this fork deleted.
