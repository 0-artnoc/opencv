OpenCV
======
An open source computer vision library

Matlab Generator
----------------
This project is a fork of OpenCV (https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/) with a matlab module for automatically generating Matlab bindings. Once complete, this branch will be merged into the OpenCV 3.x master.

This project is currently, and always will be, in a semi-working state. When the project is stable and merged, this fork will be deleted. Thus, this repository stands as a point to share progress with the community, host a bugtracker for bug reports and (public!) feature requests, and enable discussion about design decisions.

GSOC
----
This project repesents my Google Summer of Code (GSOC) project for 2013. 
You can find more details about my proposal in proposal.pdf in the root.
